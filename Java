---------
serialisation in java
hashcode collision

Arrays.asList()
List.of()

distinct ()

collect(Collecters.toList())

For custom classes, implement equals method for the variable which we want distinct.

Collections.singletonList()

How hashmap works?
Map Interface
HashMap class

Array of buckets,
each bucket is a node/linkedlist
16 default bucket size

hashMap.put(key,value)
hashCode of key is calcualted
hashCode helps to find index/bucket

if hashCode is bigger number then lot of space goes array allocation
instead of that we do modular operation on hashCode

after index is calculated it's stored in that index related node/bucket
each node is a linkedlist
each node stores the following values
key, value, hashCode, next

node = hashCode | key | value | null

hashMap.put(key2,value2)
calculated hashCode of key2
using hashCode, index is calculated

if two keys return same hashCode, then it's hashCollision
then another node is created in the linkedlist where already one node is present


hashCode | key | value | points to next node -->  hashCode | key2 | value2 | null

in map, we can enter null as key.
when ever key is null, it goes to 0 index


Map<String,Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("aaa",1);

map has size, table
default size - 16
table has array of buckets
table = HashMap$Node<K,V>
$ signifies Node is innerClass of HashMap

String str1 = "FB";
String str2 = "Ea";
str1, str2 return same hashCode

if two keys return same hashCode, then it's hashCollision
str1 is stored in first node, str2 in second node of same linkedlist


#During duplicate key
latest value gets updated

#During null key
when ever key is null, it goes to 0 index

loadFactor, threshold 
default loadFactor=0.75
when map is 75% full, table size will be doubled

how do we know map is 75% full, we come to know by threshold
threshold = loadFactor * size
default threshold = 0.75 * 16 = 12

when map crosses threshold, table size will be doubled


# get operation
hashCode of key is compared
then equals() method to compare key
if key doesn't match goes to next node of the linkedList and does same
once key is matched, we will get the value of the key

equals and hashcode

List vs Set

ArrayList Internals

Failfast vs Failsafe collections
failsafe consumes more memory as it creates a copy

ArrayList<String> namesList = new ArrayList<>();
List<String> listofNames = Arrays.asList("pavan","bhavani","kumar","kari");
namesList.addAll(listofNames);
for(String name : namesList ){
System.out.println(name);
namesList.remove(2); // throws java.util.ConcurrentModificationException
}

Iterator<String> nameIterator = namesList.iterator();
while(nameIterator.hasNext()){
	String currName = nameIterator.next();
	if(currName.equals("pavan")){
		nameIterator.remove();
		System.out.println();
	}
}



The asList() method of java.util.Arrays class is used to return a fixed-size list backed by the specified array. 
public static List asList(T... a)


new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();
then we can add to the list without java.util.ConcurrentModificationException

Singleton design pattern
GOF Singleton vs Spring Singleton

How implement singleton design pattern in java


Factory Design Pattern
------
stream api, complex methods like grouping by
immutable class
hashmap customer key object
