In JPA, we have two options to define the composite keys: the @IdClass and @EmbeddedId annotations.
In order to define the composite primary keys, we should follow some rules:
The composite primary key class must be public.
It must have a no-arg constructor.
It must define the equals() and hashCode() methods.
It must be Serializable.

for entity class:
@IdClass(AccountId.class)
@Id
@Id


for key class:
@Embeddable
for entity class:
@EmbeddedId
